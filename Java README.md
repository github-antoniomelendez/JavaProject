# Overview

For this project I am trying to learn the basics of Java. Learning a new programming language is hard, and making a program using the language is even harder. 
My purpose is to learn how to use and work with Java to create a console-based number guessing game. My game is called Guess The Number.
In this game, the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess it within a limited number of attempts. It is a simple, but fun game.

As a Software Engineer I want to learn on my own, I want to develop the ability to learn programming languages and develop interesting projects utilizing these languages.
My program creates an interface for a game, the main program runs the code following best practices and correct naming conventions. 
The game interacts with players through text promts and provides feedback on their guess. The program tracks player guesses using ArrayLists and displays them at the end of the game. The game ends either when the player correctly guesses the number or when they run out of attempts.

The project uses object-oriented programming principles. The main game logic is implemented in a class called GuessTheNumberGame, this class has methods like reset(), start(), play() and isOver() that work together in order to make the game function correctly. There is an interface named Game which defines the structure of the game.
this design demonstrates the usage of the implements keyword for the interface implementation. Finally, the program uses a Main file to run the program. This project is a good demonstration of how Java can be used to create an interactive application using basic language features and standard libraries.

# Development Environment

I used the Java Development Kit (JDK), this provides the tools to compile, run, and debug Java programs.
I used VS Code as my integrated development environment to write, test and debug my code.
I used the Terminal to compile and run .java files manually.

I used Java as a programming language for this project. Java is a robust and object-oriented programming language known for its reliability and portability.
The Java Development Kit was used to compile and run the code, I used Java to create claases and objects, loops, methods, an interface and inheratance, basic
input/output with Scanner and random number generation. I did not use any thrid-party libraries for this project. I used the core Java libraries included in the Java standard library. I used java.util.Scanner for user input, java.util.Random to generate the secret number, and java.util.ArrayList to manage and store the player guesses.
